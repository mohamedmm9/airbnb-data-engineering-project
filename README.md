# airbnb-data-engineering-project
The Airbnb data analytics project is a comprehensive analysis of the Airbnb listings dataset using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and Power BI. This project aims to gain insights and provide meaningful visualizations to help understand the trends, patterns, and factors influencing the Airbnb listings.

The dataset used in this project consists of various attributes related to Airbnb listings, such as location, property type, price, availability, and reviews. With the help of Python libraries like Pandas, we will perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis to uncover valuable information.

Using Jupyter Notebook, we will write Python code to import the dataset, handle missing values, remove duplicates, and convert data types if required. Additionally, we will perform statistical analysis, calculate descriptive statistics, and visualize the data using graphs, charts, and plots.

The analysis will include identifying the most popular Airbnb locations, the distribution of property types, the average price range, and the availability of listings over time. We will also explore the correlation between variables to understand the factors affecting price and customer reviews.

To enhance the visual representation of the findings, we will utilize Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool. Power BI will allow us to create interactive dashboards and reports, enabling us to present the insights in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.

By combining Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and Power BI, this Airbnb data analytics project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, uncover valuable insights, and facilitate data-driven decision-making for Airbnb hosts, customers, and stakeholders.
